[b]Version 3.10.*[/b]

[b]Fear of the Dark[/b] is a really interesting origin, but one of the endings of the chain can be a little underwhelming. Even then, you end it in possession of the Fevorian Mass Driver... and not able to do anything with it.
This mod adds a small quest chain that lets you rebuild it, and try it out!

[h1]Mass Driver Rebuilt - Fear the Dark[/h1]
If you've researched [b]Speculative Hyperlane Breaching[/b], and finished the mass driver situation, after a while an event will pop up - the scientists of Haven have come up with a proposal for rebuilding the Fevorian Mass Driver, and upgrading it for faster-than-light attacks using Speculative Hyperlane Breaching. This will happen even on existing saves where their system has been turned into a vassal!

As part of the chain:
[list][*][b]Rebuild the Mass Driver:[/b] A long project using a construction ship, that can be performed even if the system is a vassal.
[*][b]Target the Hyper-Mass Driver:[/b] A short project using a cloaked science ship, started by moving into orbit of a hostile world undetected.
[*][b]Fire the Hyper-Mass Driver:[/b] Unleash the incredible power of the mass driver upon your target!
[*][b]Deal with the Consequences:[/b] The mass driver certainly worked out well for the Fevorians...
[*][spoiler][b]Get a new Relic:[/b] The Heart of Fevor[/spoiler][/list]

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[quote]How do you select a target world for the Mass Driver?[/quote]
You need to move a cloaked science ship into orbit of a planet with an owner who is hostile to you (or who you have 'hostile' opinion to). They must be a normal Empire, not a Fallen or Awakened Empire.
[quote]Can the AI do this quest?[/quote]
No, as frankly nobody wants to deal with the AI sniping their homeworld.
[quote][spoiler]Can you build new Hyper-Mass Drivers after the first explodes?[/spoiler][/quote]
No, the balance for that would be [i]very[/i] hard to get right.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod changes no existing files so should have no compatibility issues.
