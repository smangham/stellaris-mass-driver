 mass_driver_opinion_suspicious:0 "Suspicious cloaked actions"
 mass_driver_project_repair:0 "Upgrade Mass Driver"
 mass_driver_project_repair_DESC:0 "Our construction ships will repair centuries' worth of neglect, and install modern subspace breach generators on the Fevorian Mass Driver. " 
 mass_driver_project_target:0 "Scan Mass Driver Target"
 mass_driver_project_target_DESC:0 "We must use a science ship to probe the fabric of subspace around our target planet to determine the firing parameters for the Hyper-Mass Driver's hyperlane breacher."

 mass_driver.100:0 "Fevorian Mass Driver"
 mass_driver.100.desc:0 "Though the mass driver the Fevorians used to crack 'The Divider' was impressively powerful, as they never discovered FTL technology it is long obsolete - even accelerated to a sizeable fraction of light-speed, its world-cracking tungsten rounds take centuries to arrive at their targets.\n\n After studying our scans of the weapon, scientists on Haven have made an intruiging proposal to modernise it. Using the hyperlane breaching technology employed by our science ships, but at vastly higher power, we could repurpose it to fire planet-shattering rounds at superluminal speeds directly through subspace. No threat to the [root.GetSpeciesName] would be safe."
 mass_driver.100.y:0 "We cannot waste this opportunity to secure our future."
 mass_driver.100.n:0 "Leave it. No other nation should suffer as we did."

 mass_driver.200:0 "Hyper-Mass Driver Primed"
 mass_driver.200.desc:0 "Though the process was long and expensive, we have repaired the centuries-old mass driver and retrofitted it with an advanced subspace breaching engine. Vast amounts of energy have been poured into its capacitor banks, and it now hums with power - prepared to drive a tungsten stake through the heart of one of our rivals. However, it appears likely that the spatial recoil generated by firing the §YHyper-Mass Driver§! would inflict serious damage upon the fabric of [event_target:fevorian_moon].\n\nRegardless, we need only dispatch a cloaked science ship to orbit our first target planet, and begin calculating the subspace path trajectory."
 mass_driver.200.y:0 "Excellent."
 mass_driver.200.y.tooltip:0 "§EWe must move a cloaked science ship into orbit of a planet owned by a hostile Empire.§!"

 mass_driver.300:0 "Science Ship In Position"
 mass_driver.300.desc:0 "Our ship, the §Y[From.GetName]§!, is in a stable orbit above the hostile world. A §ESpecial Project§! has been prepared to perform the complex subspace analysis required to produce a speculative hyperlane breach for the upgraded Mass Driver to use."

 mass_driver.310:0 "Science Ship Detected"
 mass_driver.310.desc:0 "Our science ship was forced to decloak whilst calculating the subspace trajectories for the Hyper-Mass Driver. We will have to dispatch another cloaked science ship to orbit a target planet."

 mass_driver.400:0 "Hyper-Mass Driver Locked"
 mass_driver.400.desc:0 "Undetected, our scientists aboard the §Y[this.GetName]§! have performed the calculations required to lock the upgraded Fevorian Hyper-Mass Driver onto its target. The capacitors are charged, and the driver's coils thrum with power. At our command, it will accelerate a tungsten round to a fraction below lightspeed, and blast it through a short-lived subspace tunnel to the centre of §Y[event_target:mass_driver_target_planet.GetName]§!, shattering it into pieces. Our first step towards a safer galaxy for all [This.owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 mass_driver.400.1:0 "Fire!"
 mass_driver.400.1.tooltip:0 "§RThis is a risky action!§!"
 mass_driver.400.2:0 "Stand down; we will target another world."
 mass_driver.400.3:0 "We cannot repeat the Fevorians' mistake."

 
 mass_driver.500:0 "Hyper-Mass Driver Fired"
 mass_driver.500.desc:0 "The §YHyper-Mass Driver§! fired, but the power unleashed by its subspace breach exceeded all our models. Whilst the tungsten round shattered [event_target:mass_driver_target_planet.GetName] as we hoped, the energies released as it fired also ripped apart the fabric of subspace around it.\n\nNot just §YFevoria§!, but also §YFevor§! itself have been torn apart by the space-time distortions, and it appears hyperspace travel within the The §Y[event_target:fevorian_moon.solar_system.GetName]§! system will be disrupted indefinitely."
 mass_driver.500.1:0 "We have made a terrible mistake."
 mass_driver.500.2:0 "It was worth it."
 mass_driver.500.3:0 "They deserved it."

 mass_driver_relic:0 "Heart of Fevor"
 mass_driver_relic_desc:0 "A still-cooling piece of the shattered core of Fevor, still sparking with lingering subspace distortion. A sombre reminder of either the self-destructive nature of war, or the implacable hostility of the alien, depending on who you ask."
 mass_driver_relic_modifier:0 "Salvaged Hyper-Mass Driver Relays"
 mass_driver_relic_modifier_desc:0 "Our ships have been enhanced using relays salvaged from the ruins of the Hyper-Mass Driver."
